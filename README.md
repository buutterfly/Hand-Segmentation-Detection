# Hand-Segmentation-Detection
##### Skin detection and face removal algorithm.
The purpose of this project was to develop a model to segment and detect hands in complex backgrounds. 
By our method for Hand detection and segmentation using convolutional neural networks and OTSU's thresholding techniques we were able to successfully detect hands with 96.4% accuracy.
